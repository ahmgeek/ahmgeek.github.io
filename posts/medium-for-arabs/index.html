<p>Our story is one of those stories, that embody mixtures of fun, thrill and good advice. And as most of the stories, it’s exposing us to the human being itself; his desires, that in turns plays a main role in his life philosophy.</p>
<p>Our story begins with a poor kid, not that kind of poverty that involves a very deep miserable state in life that needs a huge amount of fights against the Capitalism force of the world.No, he was poor because he wanted to write about his sadness, his wounds that got thickens by bad days. but he couldn’t find a place to vomits all of that.Well, he is a developer, and we all know that most of the developers - maybe all of them - have blogs. And blogs are not a suitable place for these kind of writing.</p>
<p>Suddenly, while he was wiping his tears, eating pizza to healing his wounds, surfing the dark side of <a href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</a>. From nowhere, <a href="http://www.manshar.com/">that Site</a> opens up in front of him!Our poor kid knew Medium, actually he tried before to write on Medium, but the lacking of Arabic support prevented him from trying again…This Manshar thing, was different, it somehow was a clone of Medium, but in Arabic…</p>

<p>Another story begins little earlier, when <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MohammadKhatib">Mohammad Khatib</a>, noticed something weird while he was answering nature’s call.</p>

<p>This story needs a realistic vision. behind the scene, Ahmad was a Zero on the left beside the team. Manshar’s lovely team:</p>
